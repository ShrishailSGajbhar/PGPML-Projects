# PGPML-Projects
*Machine learning projects done as part of an online PGPML course offered by Great Learning, an ed-tech company.*

This repository contains machine learning projects that I have implemented as part of an online **Post Graduate Program in Machine Learning (PGPML)** course offered by [Great Learning](https://www.greatlearning.in/pg-program-machine-learning-course) during November 2019 to June 2020.

The repository folders are organized according to the machine learning module name and each folder consists of a problem statement document, a jupyter notebook and the dataset.

The ML modules covered are:
* Applied Statistics (or Statistical Learning)
* Supervised learning
* Ensemble Techniques
* Unsupervised learning
* Featurization, Model Selection and Tuning
* Recommendation Systems
* Capstone project

Feel free to ask any queries regarding the projects through email  (email-id: shrishailgajbhar5@gmail.com).
